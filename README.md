// Code Structure 
The program consists of a single C++ source file (security_system.cpp) with the following key components:
User Interface: Displays a menu with options for registration, login, password change, and program termination.
Switch Case: Uses a switch statement to handle user choices and execute corresponding actions.
File Handling: Manages user data using file I/O operations for registration, login, and password change.
